# Docker Setup & PHP Nginx Server Provisioning

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ac8b484e13b24c9286eb92dd358f9455)](https://www.codacy.com/app/gemmadlou/Node-Nginx-PHP-Shell-Script?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=gemmadlou/Node-Nginx-PHP-Shell-Script&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

### Why?

I wanted to be able to test the provision of cloud server boxes that don't have anything. I won't be using Docker on production, so I wanted a very basic box, and use Nodejs shell scripting to provision PHP, Nginx and further on, other tools like MySQL etc. Hopefully this box will be a basis for provisioning real servers.

## Roadmap

Local mysql setup

Allow param configs to build server options

Create an option to read options from a config file eg. server ip etc
